## Developer Guide

While developing I learned a few things that seemed to work after some
struggles.

1.  Make sure to use Python 3.10 if you want to use Gradio. This is
    strange. With `uv` I can use 3.11 and Gradio just fine. But the
    moment I push to Github the `nbdev` CI action fails with the
    statement that my app can at most support 3.10.16. I think that is
    because in Github `pip` is used and not `uv`.
2.  I also think you need Python 3.10 if you want to deploy to
    HuggingSpaces. Lower is possible, higher is not yet supported by
    HuggingSpaces.
3.  I thought that we needed Python 3.11 to be able to combine `nbdev`
    with `uv`. But I haven’t noticed any issues yet.
