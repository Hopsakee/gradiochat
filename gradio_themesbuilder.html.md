# Gradio theme builder

## Start theme builder

The following command starts a convenient user interface to build the
code for the appearance of the Gradio user interface. Usually this will
be running on your local device on http://127.0.0.1:7860. It can be
accessed via your browser. Thereâ€™s also an online version available at
[Gradio docs Theming guide](https://www.gradio.app/guides/theming-guide)
and [HuggingFace spaces: Theme
Builder](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Nymbo/gradio_theme_builder). But
both of these versions are less responsive than running it locally
through this module.

``` python
gr.close_all()
```
